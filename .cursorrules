# Rules

## Business Rules

- Output logs in the following cases
  - Function arguments and return values
- Use logger for logging that is committed. However, use print for debugging logging.

## Formatting Rules

- Use `from logging import getLogger` instead of `import logging`
  - To avoid using `logging.info(...)`
- Define `logger = getLogger(__name__)` at the beginning of each file.
- When checking values in logs, it is common to use a combination of the f-string and the equal operator.
  - Example: `print(f"{history=}")`
- Comments that are obvious from the code are unnecessary. Write “Why Not” in cases where the original design was incorrect.

## Meta Rules

- Even if the instructions are in Japanese, write comments in the code in English.
